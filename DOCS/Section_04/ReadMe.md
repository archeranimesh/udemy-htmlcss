## Design & Ideas ##

* We should look at some themes website for inspiration of design, like [BootStrap Themes](https://themes.getbootstrap.com/)


## File Structure  ##
* CSS file is generally named as `style.css` or `main.css`
* Different thought are present to add both Navbar and showcase area to `<header>` tag or only the navbar.
* We should never have multiple id on the same page, though we can have class.
* The logo should always take us to the `index.html`
* We should add a CSS reset at the beginning with both margin and padding to be 0.
    * We can also have `box-sizing` defined as `border-box`
