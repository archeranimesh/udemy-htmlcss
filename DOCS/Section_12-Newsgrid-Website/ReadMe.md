## NavBar Guide ##
* The `nav` bar should have a `div` which acts like a container, making it only expand till `max-width`.
* [DynamicDriver](http://tools.dynamicdrive.com/favicon/) is a great tool to make favicon from png images.
* `img` tag takes the width according to the source, so always give the width as `100` %, so it takes the width of the container.
* `justify-self` is used to align the item inside its container.
