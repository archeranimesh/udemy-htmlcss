# Section 11 | CSS Grid #

## Introduction ##

* CSS Grid as the name suggest, provides a Grid Layout system.
* Similar to flex box, but little complicates as we can make 2D layout.
* `align-items`, `justify-content` are supported.
* `display:grid` : creates a grid, and is set on a container just like flex box.
* All direct child are grid items.
* `grid-template-columns` : defines width and number of columns.
* We can use flex within grid, grid can handle complete web page, where as the flex can handle a layout.

### Flex Vs Grid ###
* It is not a mutually exclusive case, we can use a combination of both.
* CSS Grids can be used for outer element and Grid like Layouts.
* Flex can be used for inner element.
